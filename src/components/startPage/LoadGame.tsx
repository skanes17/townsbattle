// REMEMBER: Basic Structure is in paper notes
// LoadGame is a Route
// That Route will have a loader=loadGameLoader
// it loads the saves which are currently found in localStorage (eventually could be fetched by API with backend)
// Once those saves are loaded into the component, they'll be accessed then mapped similar to the process seen below
// When the Link is clicked, it'll pass the unique ID
// That links to a Route which uses dynamic routing -- eg <Route path ="/:${save.gameId}" /> or whatever else is needed
// Game uses useParams to grab that ID, and it'll get the proper save data to show in the game
// That game data is then saved to state immediately upon loading, and the game should pick up in the right place
