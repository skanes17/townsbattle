-GAME IDEAS-
Novice Mode: starts with just resources and units, buildings show up as options after 2-3 rounds of combat
Veteran Mode: starts with buildings already available for construction

Critical hit chance (eg 5%)
Units who face off against each other have lower hit chance
-TRAITS-
Tankys reduce all damage to them by 1 (armor)
Pewpews can attack first before the enemy unit does
Melee can be base unit
If a unit survives a round, then it can keep attacking (instead of going back into the army)
If a unit was to die, it comes back with 1 health instead of dying
Passively lower the enemy attack by X
Cheap unit can be 'fodder' and has a higher chance of being selected

-COMBAT-
Have an option for autoplay (not the sim) that steps forward every 1/2 seconds or something

-UNITS-
Make a list of melee, pewpew, tanky names that can be pulled from when units are generated
-Maybe melee names could be a huge list of fighter names, pewpew could be mage names, tanky could be orc?

-PLANNING-
Have a log somewhere in planning to hold the alerts (eg. "Not enough resources!")
--maybe could be a pop-up animation right where you've clicked
â€¢ Maybe simplify the card systems... have the names and icons, and when you click it opens
  a menu and you can then choose where to put your resources or something. Something cleaner anyway.

-STYLING the COSTS-
Each resource on its own line, perhaps like this:
  ðŸªµ 15 / 3
  ðŸª¨ 14 / 5
  ðŸ”© 2 / 3
Then you can see how many you have, how many you need.

-TODO-
Get post-combat menu calculating properly
Change emoji's to images
Add a proper popup to replace alerts (eg "not all freeworkers assigned!")
Points system
--Maybe a simple starting approach could be every enemy unit killed adds to total score
Enemy army function-Buffs/traits (systems approach)
Get AutoBattler to produce combat log
Incorporate taunts in battle
Popups/hovertext for Planning cards
Redesign/improve main page UI
-Remove the Main Menu Summary (DevTool)
Fill out Options, How to Play, etc
Redesign Planning UI
Color scheme overhaul
New sprites/names for units/cards
Change unit names to variables for easier upkeep (change in one place, should cascade through)
Convert the End Turn button to multi-purpose
-On a set turn, it'll also call an GenerateEnemyArmy function that builds out their army
