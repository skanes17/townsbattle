-GAME IDEAS-
Novice Mode: starts with just resources and units, buildings show up as options after 2-3 rounds of combat
Veteran Mode: starts with buildings already available for construction

Can burn resources to trigger a special combat ability? (may require extra work)
Allow for x number of commands/interventions by the player per turn, trigger special abilities/buffs

-clicking on buildings could display a modal, which will allow you to create units from there and get upgrades
--This has been drafted!

Critical hit chance (eg 5%), chance to hit

--UNIT and BUILDING ABILITIES--
DEVIN's IDEAS
Knights reduce all damage to them by 1 (armor)
Archers can attack first before the enemy unit does
Fighter can be base unit
If a unit survives a round, then it can keep attacking (instead of going back into the army)
If a unit was to die, it comes back with 1 health instead of dying
Passively lower the enemy attack by X
Cheap unit can be 'fodder' and has a higher chance of being selected
Units who face off against each other have lower hit chance
Add/subtract damage
Double/half damage if enemy equals unit type
Prevent death if building is active
Unit will always stay active if building is active

UNITS
-Attacks twice before being sent back (low attack)
-Unit always attacks first, or maybe attacks first when paired against a specific type
-Rage/hulking - unit gets +1 atk every time it's damaged (up to a max, eg max +3 attack) 
-Extra armor/hp
-Bonus to attack when at full health
-Saving throw - if they were gonna die, come back with 1 hp (and maybe decreased damage?) 
-Automatically win when facing enemies with low health (eg 1 hp or less than x hp) 
-Weak, cheap unit type that always goes at the beginning of combat
-Tough Skin - can absorb first hit up to a certain damage (eg need to exceed 3 dmg) 
-Cocooned Warrior (bad name) - 1 hp 1 atk, if it goes x matchups without being chosen it grows in power (eg after waiting in army for x turns it turns into a strong fighter)
-Berserk - double damage for first matchup
-Shattered/Revenant - Weak unit with a few hp, when it dies, comes back stronger but has 1 hp
-Firewall - Burns the ground on attack; next 2 units take x damage when they join the combat (complicated?)
-Absorb/Release damage - Get hit first for X damage, next hit damages for attack + X (maybe can absorb up to a limit)
-Vicious Mockery/Taunt - Enemy attack +x, but takes +x extra damage

BUILDINGS
-More resources gathered per worker
-More health for certain buildings
-Buff a specific unit type 
-Buff all units
-Decrease chance to hit a friendly building
-Increase chance to hit for certain units (assuming chance to hit does not start at 100%)
-Allow a unit type to dodge one attack or first attack
-Allow scouts -- more detailed info given on enemy army before combat
-Buff the town center (+x health)
-Can steal/convert x enemy units at start of combat (maybe overly complex...)
-Extra points per enemy defeated (building maybe expensive to build... like a wonder/monument or something) 
-Can revive x units during combat (maybe when all units die some can be res'd instead of combat ending)
-Can heal x units for y hp after combat
-Units get x amount stronger based on number of times town has survived
-COMBAT ACTION UNLOCKED: Coinshot - blast coins at the enemy army, dealing 1 damage to x random enemy units
-COMBAT ACTION UNLOCKED: Reflect - Atk becomes 0, in combat gets hit first, but then damages the enemy for equal HP
-COMBAT ACTION UNLOCKED: Shriek - spooks the opposing enemy, keeps them from attacking for 1 turn and they are not returned to army

-----

-COMBAT-
Have an option for autoplay (not the sim) that steps forward every 1/2 seconds or something

-UNITS-
Make a list of fighter, archer, knight names that can be pulled from when units are generated
-Maybe fighter names could be a huge list of fighter names, archer could be mage names, knight could be orc?

-PLANNING-
Have a log somewhere in planning to hold the alerts (eg. "Not enough resources!")
--maybe could be a pop-up animation right where you've clicked
â€¢ Maybe simplify the card systems... have the names and icons, and when you click it opens
  a menu and you can then choose where to put your resources or something. Something cleaner anyway.

DONE-STYLING the COSTS-
Each resource on its own line, perhaps like this:
  ðŸªµ 15 / 3
  ðŸª¨ 14 / 5
  ðŸ”© 2 / 3
Then you can see how many you have, how many you need.

-CARD REFACTOR-
Consider making them more composable
Can split the card parts out:
  <Card image={backgroundimage}>
    <CardHeader>Barracks</CardHeader>
    <CardBody>Create a militia unit</CardBody>
    <CardFooter>
      <CardButton>+1</CardButton>
      <CardButton>-1</CardButton>
    </CardFooter>
  </Card>
Then use specialized components to fill it out in a consistent manner.
CardHeader will always go to the top.
CardBody always goes to the middle and you can put whatever you want there.
CardFooter can contain your buttons that you just wire up


-TODO-
DONE-Get post-combat menu calculating properly
DONE-Change emojis to images
Add a proper popup to replace alerts (eg "not all workers assigned!")
Enemy army function-Buffs/traits (systems approach)
Get AutoBattler to produce combat log
Incorporate taunts in battle
DONE-Popups/hovertext for Planning cards
Redesign/improve main page UI
-Remove the Main Menu Summary (DevTool)
Fill out Options, How to Play, etc
DONE-Redesign Planning UI
DONE-Color scheme overhaul
DONE-New sprites/names for units/cards
Change unit names to variables for easier upkeep (change in one place, should cascade through)
Convert the End Turn button to multi-purpose
DONE-On a set turn, it'll also call an GenerateEnemyArmy function that builds out their army
