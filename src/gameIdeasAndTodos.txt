-GAME IDEAS-
Novice Mode: starts with just resources and units, buildings show up as options after 2-3 rounds of combat
Veteran Mode: starts with buildings already available for construction

Critical hit chance (eg 5%)
Units who face off against each other have lower hit chance
-TRAITS-
Tankys reduce all damage to them by 1 (armor)
Pewpews can attack first before the enemy unit does
Melee can be base unit
If a unit survives a round, then it can keep attacking (instead of going back into the army)
If a unit was to die, it comes back with 1 health instead of dying
Passively lower the enemy attack by X
Cheap unit can be 'fodder' and has a higher chance of being selected

--UNIT and BUILDING ABILITIES--
UNITS
-Attacks twice before being sent back (low attack)
-Can dodge one attack (maybe allowed by a building/upgrade) 
-unit always attacks first, or maybe attacks first when paired against a certain type
-rage/hulking - unit gets +1 atk every time it's damaged (up to a max, eg max +3 attack) 
-Passively reduce enemy attack by x
-Extra armor/hp
-saving throw - if they were gonna die, come back with 1 hp (and maybe decreased damage?) 
-automatically win against enemies with 1 hp (or less than x) 
-weak, cheap unit type that always goes at the beginning of combat
-tough skin - can absorb first hit up to a certain damage (eg need to exceed 3 dmg) 
-ringbearer - 1 hp 1 atk, if it goes x matchups without taking damage it grows in power (eg after waiting in army for x turns it turns into a viable fighter) 


BUILDINGS
-More resources gathered per worker
-More health for certain buildings
-Decrease chance to hit a friendly building
-Increase chance to hit for certain units (assuming chance to hit does not start at 100%)
-can steal one enemy unit (maybe overly complex...)
-extra points per enemy defeated (maybe expensive to build... like a bank or wonder/monument or something) 
-Can revive x units during combat
-Can heal x units for y hp after combat
-Units get x amount stronger based on number of times town has survived
-----

-COMBAT-
Have an option for autoplay (not the sim) that steps forward every 1/2 seconds or something

-UNITS-
Make a list of melee, pewpew, tanky names that can be pulled from when units are generated
-Maybe melee names could be a huge list of fighter names, pewpew could be mage names, tanky could be orc?

-PLANNING-
Have a log somewhere in planning to hold the alerts (eg. "Not enough resources!")
--maybe could be a pop-up animation right where you've clicked
â€¢ Maybe simplify the card systems... have the names and icons, and when you click it opens
  a menu and you can then choose where to put your resources or something. Something cleaner anyway.

-STYLING the COSTS-
Each resource on its own line, perhaps like this:
  ðŸªµ 15 / 3
  ðŸª¨ 14 / 5
  ðŸ”© 2 / 3
Then you can see how many you have, how many you need.

-TODO-
Get post-combat menu calculating properly
Change emoji's to images
Add a proper popup to replace alerts (eg "not all freeworkers assigned!")
Enemy army function-Buffs/traits (systems approach)
Get AutoBattler to produce combat log
Incorporate taunts in battle
Popups/hovertext for Planning cards
Redesign/improve main page UI
-Remove the Main Menu Summary (DevTool)
Fill out Options, How to Play, etc
Redesign Planning UI
Color scheme overhaul
New sprites/names for units/cards
Change unit names to variables for easier upkeep (change in one place, should cascade through)
Convert the End Turn button to multi-purpose
-On a set turn, it'll also call an GenerateEnemyArmy function that builds out their army
