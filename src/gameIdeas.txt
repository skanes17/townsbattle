Critcal hit chance (eg 5%)
Units who face off against each other have lower hit chance
-TRAITS-
Tankys reduce all damage to them by 1 (armor)
Pewpews can attack first before the enemy unit does
Melee can be base unit
If a unit survives a round, then it can keep attacking (instead of going back into the army)
If a unit was to die, it comes back with 1 health instead of dying
Passively lower the enemy attack by X
Cheap unit can be 'fodder' and has a higher chance of being selected

-COMBAT-
Have an option for autoplay (not the sim) that steps forward every 1/2 seconds or something

-PLANNING-
Have a log somewhere in planning to hold the alerts (eg. "Not enough resources!")
--maybe could be a pop-up animation right where you've clicked
• Maybe simplify the card systems... have the names and icons, and when you click it opens
  a menu and you can then choose where to put your resources or something. Something cleaner anyway.

-STYLING the COSTS-
Each resource on its own line, perhaps like this:
  🪵 15 / 3
  🪨 14 / 5
  🔩 2 / 3
Then you can see how many you have, how many you need.
