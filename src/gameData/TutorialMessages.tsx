          Score increases with every unit trained, building constructed, enemy
          defeated and battle won. The longer you survive, the higher score
          you'll get.

        <p>
          In <span className="font-semibold text-amber-400">Planning</span>,
          you'll spend resources to protect your town.

        <p>
          In <span className="font-semibold text-amber-400">Combat</span>,
          you'll battle increasingly tough waves of enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          To start, you'll spend your first turn assigning workers to collect
          resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use your next turns to spend resources, train units, and construct
          buildings!

          Note: In this version of the game you'll always get 1 resource per

          The enemy is building an army and your town is in danger. Train units
          to fight back.

          All units have üó°Ô∏è Attack Power and ‚ù§Ô∏è Health. Some even have üõ°Ô∏è Armor,
          and special abilties like hitting first in Combat. Hover or tap on

          Each building constructed will unlock something. That could be a new
          unit type, or a game-changing bonus! Read each card carefully to learn
          its effects.

          Each building has health and protects your{" "}

          Combat. Your Town Center is your most important building, and if it's
          destroyed it's Game Over.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wondering how a building could get destroyed? Enemy units that survive
          Combat will damage and destroy buildings. Each unit will choose one
          random building to attack with their üó°Ô∏è Attack, except your Town
          Center.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Town Center will only be targeted when no other buildings are
          left standing.
