> An enemy army approaches! Collect resources, train units, construct buildings, and defeat waves of enemies. Survive as long as you can!

## General Info

- "Townsbattle" is my second project, created with the purpose of learning and matering React JS. I started the journey with no prior knowledge in React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, or Node.js/NPM. There was a very steep learning curve, and I made countless mistakes, but through building Townsbattle I gained valueable experience and expertise in these technologies while creating a fun and unique game. As an avid gamer who had never tried building my own game this was a fantastic and rewarding challenge.

I hope this project inspires others to explore new tech and improve their skills!

## More About The Game

- "Townsbattle" is a turn-based strategy game in which you defend your town against waves of enemy attacks. The game has two main phases: "Planning" and "Combat."

In "Planning," you assign workers to collect resources, which you can then use to train units and construct buildings. Each building you construct unlocks something new, such as new units or game-changing bonuses.

In "Combat," you fight against increasingly tough waves of enemies with the army you have trained.

Buildings have health and help protect your Town Center, which is your most important building. If it's destroyed, it's game over.

Townsbattle was designed to be easy to play but challenging to master, with plenty of opportunities for strategic thinking and decision-making.
