## ❓ General Info

- "Townsbattle" is my second project, and I started it with no prior knowledge in React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, or Node.js/NPM.
- There was a very steep learning curve, and I made countless mistakes, but I was rewarded with valuable experience and expertise in these technologies while creating a fun and unique game.
- As an avid gamer who had never tried building my own game, this was a fantastic and rewarding challenge. I hope this project inspires others to explore new tech and improve their skills!

## 🕹️ How to Play

- "Townsbattle" is a turn-based strategy game in which you defend your town against waves of enemy attacks. The game has two main phases: "Planning" and "Combat."
- In "Planning," you assign workers to collect resources, which you can then use to train units and construct buildings.
- Each building you construct unlocks something new, such as new units or game-changing bonuses.
- In "Combat," you fight against increasingly tough waves of enemies with the army you have trained.
- Buildings have health and help protect your Town Center, which is your most important building. If it's destroyed, it's game over.
- Townsbattle was designed to be easy to play but challenging to master, with plenty of opportunities for strategic thinking and decision-making.
